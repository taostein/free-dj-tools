== This works within a virtual python environment == 

Create a python virtual environment. That's straightforward:

    python -m venv env

This will create a subdirectory named env that contains all the packages etc. associated with this virtual environment.

To switch into this new virtual environmnent, just do:

    source env/bin/activate

== You will need the pytube package ==

    pip3 install pytube

There is a small issue with the pytube package not working with some Youtube link formats.
To fix this, do this patch, described here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76569016/pytube-error-while-trying-to-download-a-youtube-video

Specifically, in the file env/XXX /site-packages/pytube/cipher.py

add one more pattern into the function_patterns list:

    r'\([a-z]\s*=\s*([a-zA-Z0-9$]+)(\[\d+\])\([a-z]\)',

So the final list (at line 264) looks like this:

function_patterns = [
    # https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29326#issuecomment-865985377
    # https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/48416bc4a8f1d5ff07d5977659cb8ece7640dcd8
    # var Bpa = [iha];
    # ...
    # a.C && (b = a.get("n")) && (b = Bpa[0](b), a.set("n", b),
    # Bpa.length || iha("")) }};
    # In the above case, `iha` is the relevant function name
    r'a\.[a-zA-Z]\s*&&\s*\([a-z]\s*=\s*a\.get\("n"\)\)\s*&&\s*'
    r'\([a-z]\s*=\s*([a-zA-Z0-9$]+)(\[\d+\])?\([a-z]\)',
    r'\([a-z]\s*=\s*([a-zA-Z0-9$]+)(\[\d+\])\([a-z]\)',
]

== Running the program ==

Put the Youtube URLs, one per line, in a text file, named whatever you want, say foo.txt.
Then run:

    python3 yt-dl.py foo.txt

The code will create a folder Downloads, and download the MP4 video and MP3 audio files into that directory.

By default the code will ONLY download audio.

To make it ALSO download video, do:
    python3 yt-dl.py -withvideo foo.txt

To make it ONLY download video do:
    python3 yt-dl.py -onlyvideo foo.txt
